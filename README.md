# Kagome-AI-Optimizer

This repository was developed using Python 3.9, matplotlib 3.8.4, numpy 1.26.4, and tensorflow 2.10.1. While these specific versions were used during development, the code is expected to be compatible with other recent versions as well. Key hyperparameters for the VAE-GA pipeline, such as batch_size, learning_rate, and num_cycles, are set to default values within the scripts.

To generate an initial dataset of low-energy spin configurations, first run generate_spins.py. This script requires configuring parameters inside its main() function, such as grid size and simulation settings. Upon execution, it performs a Monte Carlo simulated annealing run and creates a new directory (e.g., D/Sim_C10R10_NoRemoval_DR1000.00/) containing the lattice structure and initial training data (TrainData.npy). Once the dataset is generated, to find the ground state using the virtuous-cycle pipeline, run main_VAE_GA.py. Before running, you must set the dataset_dir_name variable inside this script to match the name of the folder created in the first step. The script will then begin the optimization process, saving outputs like energy evolution plots and final spin configurations into a results folder.

The main_VAE_GA.py script contains the core implementation of the virtuous-cycle optimization pipeline, while generate_spins.py is dedicated to creating the necessary lattice structures and initial datasets. All essential functions for energy calculation, VAE model definition, and the Genetic Algorithm are located in the custom modules EVAE_Modules.py and Other_Modules.py, which are required to run both main scripts.

If you encounter very long runtimes for complex geometries, you can adjust the search intensity within main_VAE_GA.py. The pipeline employs periodic "deep search" cycles controlled by the deep_search_period and total_iteration variables. For faster, less thorough exploration, you can increase deep_search_period to run deep searches less frequently or lower the total_iteration count for those cycles. Conversely, for maximum precision on challenging energy landscapes, decreasing the period or increasing the iterations will yield better—but more resource-intensive—results. By adjusting these variables, you can strike a balance between search speed and the quality of the final ground state.
